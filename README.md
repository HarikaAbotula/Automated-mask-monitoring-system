# Automated-mask-monitoring-system

This project presents a simplified approach to serve the purpose of face mask detection using the basic Machine Learning (ML) packages such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and Scikit-Learn.
The goal is to create a tool that can quickly and accurately, analyzes live video feeds or images to identify faces and determine whether a person is wearing a face mask or not by using computer vision technology.
The future scope:you can merge this into the survelience.
